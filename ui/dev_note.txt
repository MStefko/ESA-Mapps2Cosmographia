- Use QtDesigner to modify the .ui files. It can be found at Anaconda3/Library/bin/designer.exe
- To compile the .ui files, use the Anaconda console command:

  pyuic5 -o juice_win_converter.py juice_win_converter.ui

  (similarly for working.ui)

  After recompiling juice_win_converter.py, you need to manually edit the line "import logo_rc" to "import ui.logo_rc"
  and move it to the top of the file

- To compile the logo.qrc, use:

  pyrcc5 -o logo_rc.py logo.qrc
