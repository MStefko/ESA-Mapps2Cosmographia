BepiColombo MMO Spacecraft SCLK File -- TEST DATA -- FICTIONAL
===========================================================================
 
   This file is a SPICE spacecraft clock (SCLK) kernel containing
   information required for the BepiColombo Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter 
   (MMO) spacecraft on-board clock to UTC conversion.
   
   This file contains the data necessary for converting from ET to
   ticks for the FICTIONAL MMO spacecraft clock (clock ID code 68)
   
   This is intended for study purposes or for those situations in which
   a clock is not available for the structure whose orientation will be
   modelled by a C-kernel.
 
 
Production/History of this SCLK file

   Version 0.0 -- Feburary 28, 2017 -- Marc Costa Sitja, ESAC/ESA
   
      Initial release.


Production/History of this SCLK file
--------------------------------------------------------

   This file has been manually created by Marc Cosat Sitja (ESAC/ESA)
   and contains FICTIONAL DATA. It is intended ONLY for study purposes. 
   NO DATA ANALYSIS SHALL BE PERFORMED BASED ON THIS FILE.  
   
   This SCLK kernel is intended to be used with test CK files with
   structure IDs listed below on board the spacecraft -68 (MMO):
   
              Name              NAIF ID
      ======================   =========
       MMO_SPACECRAFT           -68000  


Usage
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   This file is used by the SPICE system as follows: programs that make
   use of this frame kernel must "load" the kernel normally during 
   program initialization. Loading the kernel associates the data items 
   with their names in a data structure called the "kernel pool". The 
   routine that loads a kernel into the pool is shown below:
                                                                               
      FORTRAN: (SPICELIB)

         CALL FURNSH ( frame_kernel_name )

      C: (CSPICE)

         furnsh_c ( frame_kernel_name );

      IDL: (ICY)

         cspice_furnsh, frame_kernel_name
         
      MATLAB: (MICE)
      
         cspice_furnsh ( 'frame_kernel_name' )

      PYTHON: (SPICEYPY)*

         furnsh( frame_kernel_name )

   This file must be loaded into the user's program in order to use the
   SPICE SCLK family of subroutines to convert JUICE FICTIONAL spacecraft
   on-board clock to ET and vice versa.
   
   This file was created and may be updated with a text editor or word
   processor.

SCLK Format
--------------------------------------------------------

     The on-board clock, the conversion for which is provided by this
     SCLK file, consists of two fields:

          P/SSSSSSSSSS:FFFFF

     where:

          P/         -- optional partition identifier

          SSSSSSSSSS -- count of on-board seconds (32 bits)

          FFFFF      -- count of fractions of a second (16 bits)

Kernel DATA
--------------------------------------------------------

   This SCLK file is constructed so that the valid SCLK strings are
   simply the number of TDB seconds that have passed since the Ephemeris
   epoch 2016-JULY-12-00:01:08.184. Thus 1/288929292.8201 simply
   represents the epoch that occurs 288929292.12514 TDB seconds past the
   ET epoch 2016-JULY-12-00:01:08.184.
 
   For all time, the clock runs at the same rate as TDB. There is only
   one partition for this clock.
